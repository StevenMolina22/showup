# Attend-Sure: Blockchain-Based Event RSVP Platform

**"Stake to commit, get rewards after showing up"**

A revolutionary crypto event platform that reduces no-shows through blockchain-native staking deposits and provides verifiable proof of attendance. Built with Next.js 15, Tailwind CSS 4, and Web3 integration.

## 🎯 The Problem

Crypto event organizers face **30-50% no-show rates**, leading to:
- Wasted resources and poor planning accuracy
- Reduced event quality and networking opportunities
- Lack of verifiable attendance tracking
- No alignment between RSVP commitment and actual attendance

Traditional platforms like Eventbrite, Lu.ma, and Meetup lack mechanisms to ensure *attendance commitment*, particularly for crypto-native communities.

## 💡 The Solution

**Attend-Sure leverages blockchain-native staking for committed RSVPs:**

- 🔒 **Stake to RSVP**: Attendees stake a refundable deposit when registering
- ✅ **Verify Attendance**: Scan QR codes or sign wallet messages on-site to confirm attendance
- 💰 **Get Rewards**: Deposits refunded automatically + bonus tokens upon verification
- ❌ **No-Show Penalty**: Forfeited deposits support community initiatives
- 🏆 **Proof of Attendance**: Non-transferable NFTs (POAPs) build verifiable participation history

## 🚀 Key Features

### Event Discovery & Aggregation
- **Multi-Source Events**: Curated crypto events from Eventbrite, Lu.ma, Meetup, and native listings
- **Smart Filtering**: AI-powered categorization for Crypto, DeFi, AI, and Dev events
- **Clean, Modern UI**: Minimalist design with responsive grid layout
- **Real-time Data**: Live event updates and availability tracking

### Blockchain RSVP System
- **Wallet Integration**: Connect with MetaMask, WalletConnect, and major Web3 wallets
- **Smart Contracts**: Trustless deposit management and automatic settlements
- **Flexible Staking**: Customizable deposit amounts per event type
- **Multi-Chain Support**: Ethereum, Polygon, Base, and other EVM chains

### Attendance Verification
- **QR Code Scanning**: Event organizers generate unique QR codes for check-ins
- **Wallet Signatures**: Cryptographic proof of attendance via wallet message signing
- **Real-time Settlement**: Instant deposit refunds and reward distribution
- **Fraud Prevention**: Multi-factor verification to prevent fake check-ins

### Proof of Attendance Protocol (POAP)
- **NFT Credentials**: Non-transferable tokens proving event participation
- **Reputation Building**: On-chain attendance history for governance and community access
- **Custom Designs**: Branded POAPs for events and organizers
- **Interoperability**: Compatible with DAO governance and DID systems
